# LSTM-Neural-Networks
There are pre-trained models for each folder and are ready to be used <br>
In this example we use NASDAQ share prices as timeseries. <br>
Both .ipynb and .py files are included. <br>

A) Using LSTM neural network for foracasting timeseries <br>
B) Using LSTM neural network for timeseries anomaly detection <br>
C) Using convolutional neural network autoencoder for dimensionality reduction of timeseries <br>
